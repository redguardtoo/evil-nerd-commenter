;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This program emulates nerd-commenter.vim by Marty Grenfell.
;; It help you comment/uncomment multiple lines without selecting them.
;;
;; `M-x evilnc-default-hotkeys` assigns hotkey `M-;` to `evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines'
;; `M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines` comment or uncomment lines.
;; `M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line` will comment/uncomment from current line to
;; the specified line number. The line number is passed as parameter of the command.
;; For example, `C-u 99 evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line` will comment code from
;; current line to line 99.
;;
;; Though this program could be used *independently*, I highly recommend you use it with
;; evil (http://gitorious.org/evil)
;;
;; Evil makes you take advantage of power of Vi to comment lines in shocking speed.
;; For example, you can press key `99,ci` to comment out 99 lines.
