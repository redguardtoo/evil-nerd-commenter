* evil-nerd-commenter (current version 0.0.3)
As a developer, I often need comment/uncomment lines for debugging or adding some short comment in the code block.

As I know, the [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1218][Nerd Commenter]] for Vim is the most efficient way to doing this thing. Unfortunately, there is no similar plugin in Emacs.

That's why I develop this Nerd Commenter simulator for Emacs people.
* Why evil-nerd-commenter is better? Show me a simple use case!
Say you want to comment out nine lines. Instead pressing "C-space M-9 C-n M-;", now you can press "M-9 M-;" or ",9ci".

The key point is you need NOT mark any text to comment line(s)!

So you strike less keys to comment code than the origial "M-x comment-dwim".
* Install
evil-nerd-commenter is already uploaded to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/]]. So the best way to install it is using Emacs' package manager.
* Set up
Nothing to set up.

You may add below line into ~/.emacs which use hotkey "M-;" to toggle comment:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(global-set-key "\M-;" 'evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines)
(global-set-key "\M-:" 'evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line)
#+END_SRC

The advantage of use "M-;" is you can set mark on the first line and scroll several pages down and comment all the lines in that region by "M-;". The key point here is you save the extra two key strikes to make marked region wrap the whole content of first and second line.

I prefer vi key binds. So I also use [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil-mode]] and evil-leader.

Here is my configuration for evil-mode (OPTIONAL, some people don't use evil-mode at all because they don't like vi key bindings):
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'evil)
(require 'evil-leader)
(setq evil-leader/leader "," evil-leader/in-all-states t)
(evil-leader/set-key
  "ci" 'evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines
  "cc" 'evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line
  )
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Here are available commands:
- evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines :: comment/uncomment lines.
- evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line :: comment/uncomment from current line to the specified line.
- evilnc-toggle-comment-empty-lines :: toggle the flag to comment/uncomment empty lines

Example 1:
"C-u NUM M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines", comment/uncomment next NUM lines.

Example 2:
Select a region and "M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-lines". The region will be *automatically expanded to contain whole lines*. Then we comment/uncomment the region.

Example 3:
If you use [[http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil][evil-mode]] and get the package evil-leader installed. Comment 9 lines could be as easily as type "9<Leader>ci" (only four keys).

Example 4:
"C-u 56 M-x evilnc-comment-or-uncomment-to-the-line", comment/uncomment *from current line* to line 56.
